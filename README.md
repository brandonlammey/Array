# Array

This generic templated array data structure will create a dynamic array of pointers of a selected type in order to perform basic array operations: 

* Traversals
* Insertions 
* Deletions
* Searches
* Updates

## Purpose

To quickly perform common place array operations without the worry of directly handling the array. Focus on the end of goal of a problem and not on array operations. 



#### **Currently in progress of comleting this and adding test cases!**
