# Array

This generic templated array data structure will create a dynamic array of pointers of a selected type in order to perform basic array operations: 

* Traversals
* Insertions 
* Deletions
* Searches
* Updates

## Purpose

To quickly perform common place array operations in C++ without the worry of directly handling the array. Focus on the end of goal of a problem and not on array operations. 

## Configure

Remove Makefile and main.cpp
Add to personal code and Makefile 
Include with `#include "Array.h"`


## Tests

#### **Currently working on adding test cases!**
